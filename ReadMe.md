# Hydrogen AUV – Software and Automation Subsystem

This branch is for the Software and Automation Subsystem, and we are building our 2nd prototype — **Hydrogen**.

We are tasked with simulating the entire underwater environment in Gazebo, and getting sensor data from the simulation through ROS.

We are making the actual competition track plus a side-by-side test track to learn and implement early techniques that we want our actual bot to perform.
