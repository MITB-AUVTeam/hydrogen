# Hydrogen AUV – Software and Automation Subsystem

This branch is for the Software and Automation Subsystem, and we are building our 2nd prototype — **Hydrogen**.

We are tasked with simulating the entire underwater environment in Gazebo, and getting sensor data from the simulation through ROS.

Eventually, even on the actual bot, we will be working on getting the sensor data and camera feed for processing on the Jetson Orin, again through ROS.

The repo also includes ML and CV pipelines for image processing and autonomous navigation in the RoboSub competition.
