Sending frame structure:
- 8 bits sof (0xAE)
- 8 bits sequence number (wraps around at 0xFF, sequence gaps are permitted, and repeated sequence numbers indicate stalled telemetry)
- 16 bits BMS Current (signed) -- mA
- 16 bits BMS output voltage (unsigned) -- mV
- 16 bits Total Battery Voltage (unsigned) -- mV
- 16 bits Temp (signed) -- centi celsius
- 8 bits ERROR (say bms turned off or smth, bit field, reflects current state)
- 8 bits CRC8
    - 0x07 -- x^8 + x^2 + x + 1
    - does not cover sof
    - Init value: 0x00
    - RefIn: false
    - RefOut: false
    - XorOut: 0x00
    - Coverage: all bytes except SOF
    
ERROR format
    bit 0  : BMS off
    bit 1  : Overcurrent
    bit 2  : Undervoltage
    bit 3  : Overtemperature
    bit 4  : Comm fault
    bit 5  : Sensor fault
    bit 6–7: Reserved
When error is set, call interrupt to make master immediately push a telemetry request

Recieved frame structure:
- 8 bits sof 
- 8 bits command
- 8 bits notted command
- 8 bits crc
SOF is AE

Command structure:
    bit 7   = 1 -> command
    bit 6   = safety-critical (STOP_SYSTEM, STOP_THRUSTERS)
    bit 5-0 = command ID

Commands: (All have minimum distance of 3)
1. STOP_ELECTRONICS: No ACK, just shut down -- does not require crc match 
    11 000000
2. STOP_THRUSTERS: ACK -- does not require crc match
    11 000111
3. START_THRUSTERS: ACK -- requires crc match
    10 111000
4. TELEMETRY: response frame -- requires crc match
    10 111111
5. RESERVED (Safety non critical)
    10 010101
6. RESERVED (Safety critical)
    11 101010

ACK frame:
    Single byte: 0xA5 (4 bit ack with inverse appended on)
    Meaning: Command received and accepted
    Does NOT imply action completed 
    Make sure to query on master side
NACK frame:
    Single byte: 0x5A
    Meaning: Command recieved BUT NOT accepted due to various reasons
        - CMD / ~CMD mismatch
        - Reserved command ID
        - START_THRUSTERS while fault is latched 
        - i.e, if the command is perfect, but the logic doesnt work or the command doesnt exist, send NACK. If malformed, let master time out
ACK/NACK is sent immediately after command validation. No response is guaranteed for STOP_ELECTRONICS
